Effect handlers in Prolog.

This repositry is dedicated to the current work on effect handlers in prolog.

The respositry is divided into two partition. The source code and examples for
our syntax and to show the benchmarks.

In order to run the code, you will need two prolog systems. 
Sicstus Prolog (tested on version 4.3.1) and
hProlog (The version supporting delimited control constructs).

In order to compile a file, 
run the queries:

?- consult('CompilerWithEffects.pl').
?- compile_effects('inputfile.pl',Optimize,'outputfile.pl').

The Optimize is a variable that changes to true if you want our optimizer
to work on the code in order to remove as much delimited control constructs as possible.
If you want an un-optimized version, just a pure translation into delimited control,
then set Oprimize to false.

After getting the resulting output file, run it normally on the hProlog system.
