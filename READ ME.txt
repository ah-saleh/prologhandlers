Effect handlers in Prolog.

This repository is dedicated to the current work on effect handlers in Prolog.

The repository is divided into two partition. The source code and examples for
our syntax and to show the benchmarks.

In order to run the code, you will need two Prolog systems. 
Sicstus Prolog (tested on version 4.3.1) and

hProlog
OR
The most recent SWI-Prolog version supporting delimited continuation predicates (reset/3 and shift/1).

In order to compile a file, 
run the queries:

?- consult('CompilerWithEffects.pl').
?- compile_effects('inputfile.pl',Optimize,'outputfile.pl').

The Optimize is a variable that changes to true if you want our optimizer
to work on the code in order to remove as much delimited control constructs as possible.
If you want an unoptimized version, just a pure translation into delimited control,
then set Optimize to false.


Please read the comments on the top of each file in Examples directory for running the benchmarks.
